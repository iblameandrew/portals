No one will repeat Terrys feat; building an entire OS to prompt it as a random number generator is beyond anyones capacity in the world. But over the years something stuck with me about Terrys obsession with random numbers and matching those numbers to the content of different texts in order to "get a message from God" - esentially Terry believed that God was like a programmer, that made the world and the creations within it to entertain him. Non entertaining creations in this cosmovision are regarded as duds, and entertaining creations are regarded as the logical evolutionary step for mankind. 

Here Terry believed that in order to get a message from God you nedded to exchange love in an act of self-defeat and surrender to a greater circusmtance, in order to get for the blink of a moment Gods attention. Then upon prompting a random number generator with the "fresh scene" of the "act of love", the random number generator would respond back with a number that upon being matched with an index of the bible would emerge "order" as a synchronicity and hand a coherent message. If the offering for God was satisfying, surprisingly the message would say something meaningful as it was recorded in Terrys live-streams. A lot of times though, the offerings were not good enough and to quote Terry: God thought it was boring.

After some years ruminiating i came to understand that the essence of Terrys fixation could be broken down into two factors: the first one is doing something that enables a mesaure of change in ones perception (entertainment), and the second one, was the posteriori state that emerges as a consequence of getting retroactively a message that one wholeheartly believes to come from God and thus, on understandment force our field of judgement and perception to reorganize around the new message or "new command". In every sense of the word; what Terry Davis was doing with his temple was to open portals to navigate them.

A portal thus is something that changes the possibility of motion of an object. Realistic portals however are mental, in the same sense a movie or great piece of literature can change our field of action by measure of how they realign our thoughts and "help us see" new possibilities where preiovusly none were seen. Today with LLMs, this idea can be extended deeper into something more meaningful thats actually fun to engage in.
