No one will repeat Terrys feat; building an entire OS to prompt it as a random number generator is beyond anyones capacity in the world. But over the years something stuck with me about Terrys obsession with random numbers and matching those numbers to the content of different texts in order to "get a message from God" - esentially Terry believed that God was like a programmer, that made the world and the creations within it to entertain him. Non entertaining creations in this cosmovision are regarded as duds, and entertaining creations are regarded as the logical evolutionary step for mankind. 

Here Terry believed that in order to get a message from God you nedded to exchange love in an act of self-defeat and surrender to a greater circusmtance, in order to get for the blink of a moment Gods attention. Then upon prompting a random number generator with the "fresh scene" of the "act of love", the random number generator would respond back with a number that upon being matched with an index of the bible would emerge "order" as a synchronicity and hand a coherent message. If the offering for God was satisfying, surprisingly the message would say something meaningful as it was recorded in Terrys live-streams. A lot of times though, the offerings were not good enough and to quote Terry: God thought it was boring.

After some years ruminiating i came to understand that the essence of Terrys fixation could be broken down into two factors: the first one is doing something that enables a mesaure of change in ones perception (entertainment), and the second one, was the posteriori state that emerges as a consequence of getting retroactively a message that one wholeheartly believes to come from God and thus, on understandment force our field of judgement and perception to reorganize around the new message or "new command". In every sense of the word; what Terry Davis was doing with his temple was to open portals to navigate them.

A portal thus is something that changes the possibility of motion of an object. Realistic portals however are mental, in the same sense a movie or great piece of literature can change our field of action by measure of how they realign our thoughts and "help us see" new possibilities where preiovusly none were seen. Today with LLMs, this idea can be extended deeper into something more meaningful thats actually fun to engage in.

# How to play

The first rule of Fight Club: you dont talk about this; jk. The first rule is that you will only get out of this what you put into it. My best guess within the framework of quantum mechanics is that you will only collapse reality into a specific "beacon" by believing in it. Thats is corrupting the measurement at the other end of the channel with an entaglement: a projection. If the trace of your future decisions will be collapsed by a singular moment in time, then you "force" casuality to contain itself into the specific moment thats going to steer you into either path A or path B. If you dont take it seriously, or in your particular slice of reality there arent any "observers" taking it seriously, youll never get meaningful messages of the future within this retroactive mechannism of sorts, basically.

#### So how it works?

Esentially you perform an offering - the nature of the offering has a strict requirement. One: it must fundamentally change you - after doing the offering your reality wont be the same. If you dont do a good offering, the message will be trash. Within this framework you can either do offerings for good within Gods vision of love and unity, or you can take decisions for classical evil within the ten commandments, and still get messages anyway. The offering has to be at its foundation something that makes you transition from point of view A to point of view B - like those streamers making reaction videos. Once the "offering is fresh" or just performed, you can prompt the app and an LLM will analyze the extracted bible verse with the compatibility of your gameplay so far: if theres resonance between the verse and your gameplay, the offering was a success and the LLM goes into narration mode telling you next step of this spiritual joruney within the abstract imaginary of the LLM. If the offering was bad, then the generated random number had no semantic resonance with your gameplay and you are prompted as a player to try again and go bigger next time.

Do notice though; that the LLM is simply unraveling a book and improvising it on the basis of random bible verses coming up with demons, angels, problems; all within the framework of a DnD campaign. It's not the LLM that gets any insight whatsoever into what the offering is: thats only between "God" and you.
